			<div class="p-3 border bg-light">Bokeh is a data 
				visualization library for Python. Unlike Matplotlib and
				Seaborn, they are also Python packages for data visualization,
				Bokeh renders its plots using HTML and
				JavaScript. Hence, it proves to be extremely useful
				for developing web based dashboards.
				The Bokeh project is sponsored by NumFocus
				https://numfocus.org/. NumFocus also supports PyData, an
				educational program, involved in development of 
				important tools such as NumPy, Pandas and more.
				Bokeh can easily connect with these tools and
				produce interactive plots, dashboards and data applications.
				Features
				Bokeh primarily converts the data source into a JSON file
				which is used as input for BokehJS, a JavaScript library,
				which in turn is written in TypeScript and renders the 
				visualizations in modern browsers.
				Some of the important features of Bokeh are as follows −
				Flexibility
				Bokeh is useful for common plotting requirements as
				well as custom and complex use-cases.
				Productivity
				Bokeh can easily interact with other popular Pydata
				tools such as Pandas and Jupyter notebook.
				Interactivity
				This is an important advantage of Bokeh over Matplotlib and 
				Seaborn, both produce static plots. Bokeh
				creates interactive plots that change when the user
				interacts with them. You can give your audience a
				wide range of options and tools for inferring and
				looking at data from various angles so that user can
				perform “what if” analysis.
				Powerful
				By adding custom JavaScript, it is possible to generate 
				visualizations for specialised use-cases.
				Sharable
				Plots can be embedded in output of Flask or Django 
				enabled web applications. They can also be rendered in
				Jupyter notebooks.
				Open source
				Bokeh is an open source project. It is distributed under 
				Berkeley Source Distribution (BSD) license. Its
				source code is available on https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh
